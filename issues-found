Here's what I found, organized by priority:


Placeholder nav link in production — Navbar.tsx:33
'[Place Holder for more links]' is visible to users. Remove or replace it.

Placeholder # links — QuickLinks.tsx:9-10
"Safe School Report" and "Student Handbook" link to #. Either wire them up or visually indicate they're coming soon.

TypeScript strict mode disabled — tsconfig.json
No "strict": true means no strictNullChecks, implicit any, etc. Enable it.

Chatbot.tsx is 420+ lines doing too much — Chatbot.tsx
API logic, message state, UI state, and rendering are all mixed together. Extract a useGeminiChat() hook and a ChatMessage component.

Low / Quick Wins
Missing focus-visible styles on links (Footer.tsx:17-19) — add focus:ring-2 focus:ring-sandpiper-gold
Scroll handler in Navbar could be throttled (Navbar.tsx:9-30)
Images in SectionGrid.tsx should have loading="lazy" to avoid layout shift
No <ErrorBoundary> — a crash in any component takes down the whole app
Missing Open Graph / SEO meta tags in index.html
Easiest wins right now: fix aria-expanded, add alt text, delete commented code, remove the dead CSS link, and remove the console.log. All under 5 minutes total. Want me to handle any of these?
